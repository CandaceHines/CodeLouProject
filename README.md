Code Louisville Project Session 1


This project is from: 
https://github.com/CodeLouisville/Front-End-Project/tree/Week-3

I am trying to do the following: 

1. Go to Google Fonts http://google.com/fonts and switch out the font family.
2. Review the mockup. Look at the different ways .features-group is laid out depending on the viewport(screen) size. Add styles to the the stylesheet to replicate the layouts from the mockup. Do it without changing the HTML (HINT: :nth-child). Use the existing media queries in the stylesheet.
3. Review the mockup. Add the app store badges. Images are included in the img folder.

MY CURRENT ISSUE: I cannot figure out how to change the second image in the features to the right side.  I have tried multipl items in flexbox and also tried nth-child.  I just don't understand this portion unfortunately.  I am so stuck on this, that I am having a hard time moving past that and completing the remaining project!
